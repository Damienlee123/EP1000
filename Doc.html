            <h3>Learning how to use fusion 360</h3>
            <p>
                The first leson we had on Computer Aided Design, was learning how to use
                fusion 360.We were first taught the basics of fusion 360 on how to create a
                sketch and constrain. After that we were task to create a nametag.

            <p>
                After learning the basics we progress to more advance designs like,
                lego,Hex nut and chest piece.

            <h4>Gimp</h4>
            <p>
                The next lesson we had on Computer Aided Design was Gimp.
                we learn how to replace the back ground image of our selfie. First we had to select
                the parts ourself that we want in the new background
                ,by using the free select tool. Next we chose the new background that we want
                and import it as a new layer.Lastly we then combine the 2 image together.

            <h5>Inkscape</h5>
            <p>
                The last lesson we had on Computer Aided Design was Inkscape.
                we learn how to create an image in to vector. First open a picture that
                you want to convert in to vector.Next select path>Trace Bitmap.Lastly, play
                around with the function till you get your desire vector image. The function i
                selected was multiple scan>colour>scan(8)>select remove background and stack>Apply.

            <h6>Music Box</h6>
            <p>
                The first assignment we were task to do using fusion 360 was to create a music box with a lid.
                I first started with a simple sketch of the music box to help me visualise better.Then i added in
                the dimensions and the amount of tabs.This made it easier to fill in the parameter, and prevent any
                typo error.When creating the music box, i found out many comands that made the whole process faster. The comands are
                parameters, combine,rectangle pattern, mirror and insert.
            </p>
            <img src="images/sketch.jfif" alt="image of project" width="600px" height="400px" />
            <p>
                Instead of going into every sketch and change the dimension
                one by one, parameter allow me to give the dimesion a variable, so instead of typing out the dimension,
                i will just indicate the variable.
            </p>
            <img src="images/parameter.jfif" alt="image of project" width="600px" height="400px" />
            <p>
                I used combine and rectangle pattern comand for creating the tabs that connects the pieces together. First i
                create a sketch of the tab that i want to create. I would then extrude and use rectangular pattern to get multiple
                of the extrude feature on the selected side. After that i would create another surface on the same plane as the
                tabs, and use the combine comand to create exactly where the tabs would be on the new surface.
            </p>

            <img src="images/combine.jfif" alt="image of project" width="450px" height="200px" />
            <p>
                Once i have finished one side of the music box, i would use mirror comand to create a 
                symetrical side on the other side, this saved me the trouble of having to repeat what i
                dis for that surface and prevent me from making mistakes.

            <p>
                For the lion head i used insert comand to bring in a lion head image that i found on google.
                I used spline comand to trace out the lion head, and use extrude comand to cut it to
                create an engrave look.This process took me the longest as i have to trace out the lion'
                head in detail.
