                Final project. It will be a mood lamp x motivation quote. The deisgn of the product is in
                the shape of a star. The side of the lamp will be made of  translucent material so that it
                will defuse the colour(yellow) of the light, creating a warm effect that is pleasing to look at.
                The unique selling point of the product is that it is multifunctional. It can display motivational
                quotes, moodlamp, and a great decoration for the table. To create this effects, it is important to
                know how it works. To turn on the digital clock, simply hover your hand close to the bottom of the
                product. It uses a ultra-sonic sensor to detect any object in its surrounding. Once it detect an
                object, 2 things will happen. First it will automatically turn on the LCD to display encouraging
                quotes, and secondly, the Neo pixel led will light up progressively, getting brighter and brighter
                as the time goes on. I will reach its brightest in exactly 1 min. After that every thing will turn
                off and you have to activate it again. Link to video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SquC1LF6dyU">Star power</a>

            <p>
                To start off my project, I use thinginverse to looks for inspiration for my project.
                I came a across a digital clock/mood lamp/table top decoration. Its minimalistic design
                accompany by its multi-functional features makes it a great product.
