                Final project. It will be a mood lamp x motivation quote. The deisgn of the product is in
                the shape of a star. The side of the lamp will be made of  translucent material so that it
                will defuse the colour(yellow) of the light, creating a warm effect that is pleasing to look at.
                The unique selling point of the product is that it is multifunctional. It can display motivational
                quotes, moodlamp, and a great decoration for the table. To create this effects, it is important to
                know how it works. To turn on the digital clock, simply hover your hand close to the bottom of the
                product. It uses a ultra-sonic sensor to detect any object in its surrounding. Once it detect an
                object, 2 things will happen. First it will automatically turn on the LCD to display encouraging
                quotes, and secondly, the Neo pixel led will light up progressively, getting brighter and brighter
                as the time goes on. I will reach its brightest in exactly 1 min. After that every thing will turn
                off and you have to activate it again. Link to video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SquC1LF6dyU">Star Power</a>

            <h4>Ideation</h4>
            <p>
                To start off my project, I use thinginverse to looks for inspiration for my project.
                I came a across a digital clock/mood lamp/table top decoration. Its minimalistic design
                accompany by its multi-functional features makes it a great product.

            <h5>Rough sketch</h5>
            <p>
                With minimalistic being the main feature, i decide to make a product that is both stylish
                and multi-functional. To make it unique, i change a few component; shape and clock function.
                Instead of a clock function, i changed it to display encouraging messages, to motivate the user.
                To fit the theme of motivation, i decided to shape the moodlamp into a star, and give it a cute face
                as part of the design. I choose a star shape, because it symbolise great achievements.

            <h6>Electronics</h6>
            <p>
                For my electronic part, i decided to use an ultra-sonic sensor as my in-put device, and both neo pixel
                and LCD display as my out-put device. The reasoning behind this is because both the ultra-sonic sensor
                and LCD adds character to my product, acting as the eyes and mouth. The led is use to create a mood
                lamp effect.Link to video <a href="https://youtu.be/otW0htlSbFQ">Star Power (electronics)</a>

            <h7>Arduino Code</h7>
            <p>
                To make my electronics run. I use arduino to code how i want my electronics to perform. Here is a
                brief run down of how my electronic work from start to finish. First, the ultra-sonic sensor detect
                any object within 7.5cm, which trigger the led and lcd. The lcd will display encouraging messages,
                while the led will progressively get brighter, reaching its brightest in 1 min. After 1 min,
                everything will stop and user have to move an object within range of the ultra-sonic sensor.

            <p>
                I use thinker cad to visualize how my circuit will  connect and also to check whether it will work.
                It gives me the freedom to try out many ways of connecting my circuit, and how my circuit would act.

            <p>
                The components that i 3d printed for my product are the casing of the whole product and a Arduino Uno
                R3 holder. I use inventor to design the components. For the printing machine, I use Creality Ender 3
                Pro, as It provide the fastest printing speed and best build quality. For my slicing soft ware, i use
                the latest version of cura, cura 5.10, which helps speed up the printing time by alot.

            <h10>2D Laser cutting</h10>
            <p>
                The 2D component that i laser cut was the shape of he star. I had to laser cut 2 piece, one is
                the front which contain all the holes for the ultra-sonic sensor and LCD. We use the Software Corel
                draw to import our image that we want to laser cut. In the software, we had to learn what are the
                setting we have to input, depending on the type of cut, and the material. In my case i use  5mm ply
                wood, and all my cut is vector. So i had to make sure the type of my line is "hairline", next we had
                to on aim assist and auto focus. Then we have to add in the percentage of power, frequency, cut speed
                and thickness of the material.

            <p>
                Bill of material is a list that shows all the components use in the project. it consist of the name,
                quantity,shop, and total cost.
